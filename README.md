## Understanding Fungible and Non-Fungible Tokens

#### **Fungible Tokens (FTs):**
Imagine you have something that can be swapped with an identical item without losing or gaining value—like money. If you lend your friend a $10 bill, it doesn't matter if they give you back the same bill or a different $10 bill; they're worth the same.

- **In short**: Fungible tokens are things that are exactly the same in value and can be easily exchanged for one another.

#### **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs):**
Now, think of something unique—like a piece of art or a concert ticket. No two are exactly the same. If you lend a friend a concert ticket for a front-row seat, you wouldn't want them to return a ticket for a seat in the back row because the value is different.

- **In short**: Non-fungible tokens are unique, one-of-a-kind items that can't be exchanged directly for another of the same type because they're different in some way.

##### Examples of Fungible Tokens (FTs) in Everyday Life:
1. **Currency**: Any $10 bill is the same as another $10 bill.
2. **Gift Cards**: A $50 gift card for Amazon is the same as any other $50 Amazon gift card.
3. **Points**: Airline miles or credit card rewards points—one mile or point is the same as another.
4. **Commodities**: Things like gold or oil. An ounce of gold from one source is the same as an ounce from another.

##### Examples of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) in Everyday Life:
1. **House Deeds**: Each property is unique, and the deed represents ownership of a specific one.
2. **Artwork**: A painting by an artist is unique, even if two pieces look similar.
3. **Event Tickets**: Tickets for a concert or sporting event differ in value based on seat location or perks.
4. **Identification Cards**: Your passport or driver’s license is specific to you and cannot be swapped with someone else’s.
